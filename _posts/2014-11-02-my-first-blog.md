title: My First Blog
---

This is my first Blog on github.  I have finally got some relation with github.  Anyway, I am a coder, right?

Why blog?
--------------------------------------------

In my opinion, one will write something down if he has experienced years’ life with his heart.  Blog is just what it is named after — web log.  We need to record something meaningful or interesting while SNS is something quick, convenient but not endurable.  We tend to share our selfies or opinions quite casually so as not to remember what we have published in just few days.  But writing a blog is more formal and needs much more consideration.  We have enough time to organize our mind and make relative reasonable analysis.

I have left school for 8 years.  During these years, I have learned something and formed some thoughts.  I need a platform to note and share them, so I turn to Blog for help.  Blog is ideal for me to write something.  Let’s see how long can I stick to.

Why GitHub?
--------------------------------------------

At the very beginning, I used sina, but as a coder, I need something else, something simple and controllable.   GitHub is a wonderful place to organize projects, it is an assembly for developers.  We can see lots of open source projects are held there.  Besides, it is really convenient to set up personal sites.  You just create a username.github.io repository and upload your html, then a personal site is set up.  Easy and direct, is it?

And hosting personal web site on GitHub is same as hosting a open source software project.  You commit your changes and push it to origin.  Quite comfortable to developers.  GitHub supports Jekyll and we can easily build our own blog systems.

What’s more?
--------------------------------------------

I have no idea about webpage technologies such as CSS, html or anything else.  My blog is simple for now and I will upgrade it later.  To study knowledge of other fields is also a good thing.
